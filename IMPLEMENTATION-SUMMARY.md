## 🎨 Animation Details

### Timeline Breakdown:

**Page Load (0-3 seconds):**
```
0.0s  → Header appears
0.5s  → Profile image bounces in
0.8s  → "Hello, I'm" appears
1.0s  → Name appears
1.2s  → Role appears
1.4s  → Description appears
1.8s  → Buttons appear
2.0s  → Social icons appear
2.5s  → Faded text appears
```

**Continuous Animations:**
- Profile image floats up/down (2s duration, infinite loop)
- Parallax effect on scroll

**Scroll Animations:**
- Triggered when section reaches 70-80% viewport
- Smooth fade + slide combinations
- Stagger effects for multiple elements

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Mobile Detection**
   - Reduced animation complexity on mobile
   - Limited ScrollTrigger callbacks
   - Optimized sync interval

2. **ScrollTrigger Best Practices**
   - `toggleActions: "play none none reverse"`
   - Animations reverse when scrolling up
   - No unnecessary replays

3. **Will-Change CSS** (recommended to add)
   - Add to animated elements for smoother performance

## 🔍 How to Test

### 1. Open in Browser
```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\Personal-Web-Portfolio-main

# Open index.html in browser
# Recommended: Use Live Server in VS Code
```

### 2. Check Console

## 💡 Tips for Further Customization

### Adjusting Animation Speed:
```javascript
// In gsap-animations.js, change duration values
duration: 0.8  // Faster: 0.5, Slower: 1.2
```

### Changing Easing:
```javascript
ease: "power2.out"  // Try: "elastic.out", "back.out", "bounce.out"
```

### Modifying Stagger Delay:
```javascript
stagger: 0.2  // Increase for slower sequential animation
```

### Adjusting Scroll Trigger Points:
```javascript
start: "top 70%"  // Earlier: "top 80%", Later: "top 60%"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Animations Not Working?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure GSAP CDN links are loading
3. Verify gsap-animations.js is after GSAP library
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Animations Too Fast/Slow?
1. Adjust `duration` values in gsap-animations.js
2. Modify stagger amounts
3. Change easing functions

### ScrollTrigger Not Firing?
1. Check `start` and `end` values
2. Add `markers: true` for debugging
3. Call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after page load

### Mobile Performance Issues?
1. Reduce animation complexity
2. Increase `syncInterval` in ScrollTrigger config
3. Use `will-change` CSS property
4. Consider disabling some animations on mobile
